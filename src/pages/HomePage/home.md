## About Me
I am a current Computer Science and Engineering undergratuate student at the University of Iowa, focusing in Computer Hardware. Topics in computer hardware, IoT devices, and how computers function interest me.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy hiking with my family, playing basketball and poker with my friends, and taking naps with my dogs.
